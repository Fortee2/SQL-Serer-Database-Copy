# SQL-Serer-Database-Copy
SQL and Powershell scripts for exporting a database's structure and data 

## About
Most development is maintaining and enhancing existing systems.  Often times these systems do not have a way to recreate the database structure, but we need these structures to setup local development, testing, and QA environments.   Often times we use backup files and then end up writing script to obfuscate or remove sensitive data.
The purpose of this project is to simplify the process of recreating a SQL Server database structure or being able to script out sections of a database.
